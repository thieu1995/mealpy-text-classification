# Text classification with Machine Learning and Mealpy

1. SVC (Support Vector Classification)
2. NB (Naive Bayes)
3. LC (Linear Classification)
4. Bagging Model
5. Boosting Model
6. Multi-Layer Perceptron
7. Deep Neural Network
8. CNN
9. LSTM
10. GRU
11. Bidirectional RNN
12. Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network


# Environments

```code 

Open terminal in windows:

    python -m venv pve_mealpy_test
    pve_mealpy_test\Scripts\activate.bat
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
```


# How to run

Please check out all the normal model first by running the script that end with word "normal". For example:

```code 
1. run_svc_normal.py
2. run_nb_normal.py
```

After that you can check out how to use MEALPY with above models by running the script end with word "mealpy". For 
example:

```code 
1. run_svc_mealpy.py
2. run_nb_mealpy.py
```
